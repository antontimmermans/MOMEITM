High time to teach those pesky investigators a lesson and ensure they never interfere again.</i>\n\nThis scenario includes a substantial amount of battle and light puzzle challenges.

This scenario can be played with the base game.\nAll expansions or figure & tile collections will provide extra variation (and a bit more difficulty).\nAdditional layouts will come available with future updates of this scenario for expansions "Horrific Journeys", "Streets of Arkham", and "Path of the Serpent".
